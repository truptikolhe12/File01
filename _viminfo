	WHAT IS VIM?
	
	Vim is a greatly improved version of the good old UNIX editor Vi.  Many new
	features have been added: multi-level undo, syntax highlighting, command line
	history, on-line help, spell checking, filename completion, block operations,
	script language, etc.  There is also a Graphical User Interface (GUI)
	available.  Still, Vi compatibility is maintained, those who have Vi "in the
	fingers" will feel at home.  See "runtime/doc/vi_diff.txt" for differences with
	Vi.
	
	This editor is very useful for editing programs and other plain text files.
	All commands are given with normal keyboard characters, so those who can type
	with ten fingers can work very fast.  Additionally, function keys can be
	mapped to commands by the user, and the mouse can be used.
	
	Vim runs under MS-Windows (XP, Vista, 7, 8, 10), macOS, VMS and almost all
	flavours of UNIX.  Porting to other systems should not be very difficult.
	Older versions of Vim run on MS-DOS, MS-Windows 95/98/Me/NT/2000, Amiga DOS,
	Atari MiNT, BeOS, RISC OS and OS/2.  These are no longer maintained.
	
	
	DISTRIBUTION
	
	You can often use your favorite package manager to install Vim.  On Mac and
	Linux a small version of Vim is pre-installed, you still need to install Vim
	if you want more features.
	
	There are separate distributions for Unix, PC, Amiga and some other systems.
	This README.txt file comes with the runtime archive.  It includes the
	documentation, syntax files and other files that are used at runtime.  To run
	Vim you must get either one of the binary archives or a source archive.
	Which one you need depends on the system you want to run it on and whether you
	want or must compile it yourself.  Check "http://www.vim.org/download.php" for
	an overview of currently available distributions.
	
	Some popular places to get the latest Vim:
	* Check out the git repository from github: https://github.com/vim/vim.
	* Get the source code as an archive: https://github.com/vim/vim/releases.
	* Get a Windows executable from the vim-win32-installer repository:
	  https://github.com/vim/vim-win32-installer/releases.
	
	
	COMPILING
	
	If you obtained a binary distribution you don't need to compile Vim.  If you
	obtained a source distribution, all the stuff for compiling Vim is in the
	"src" directory.  See src/INSTALL for instructions.

	DOCUMENTATION
	
	The Vim tutor is a one hour training course for beginners.  Often it can be
	started as "vimtutor".  See ":help tutor" for more information.
	
	The best is to use ":help" in Vim.  If you don't have an executable yet, read
	"runtime/doc/help.txt".  It contains pointers to the other documentation
	files.  The User Manual reads like a book and is recommended to learn to use
	Vim.  See ":help user-manual".
	
	
	COPYING
	
	Vim is Charityware.  You can use and copy it as much as you like, but you are
	encouraged to make a donation to help orphans in Uganda.  Please read the file
	"runtime/doc/uganda.txt" for details (do ":help uganda" inside Vim).
	
	Summary of the license: There are no restrictions on using or distributing an
	unmodified copy of Vim.  Parts of Vim may also be distributed, but the license
	text must always be included.  For modified versions a few restrictions apply.
	The license is GPL compatible, you may compile Vim with GPL libraries and
	distribute it.
	
	
	SPONSORING
	
	Fixing bugs and adding new features takes a lot of time and effort.  To show
	your appreciation for the work and motivate Bram and others to continue
	working on Vim please send a donation.
	
	Since Bram is back to a paid job the money will now be used to help children
	in Uganda.  See runtime/doc/uganda.txt.  But at the same time donations
	increase Bram's motivation to keep working on Vim!
